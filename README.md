# Virtual Drum
The Virtual Drum is an interactive platform that simulates a musical drum instrument through a digital interface. Each button available on the screen reproduces the characteristic sound of a specific drum instrument.

Clicking on "Pom", for example, produces a sound similar to the onomatopoeia, while the "Clap" button emits a sound of applause. Similarly, buttons like "Tim", "Splash", and others, play a variety of sounds typical of an acoustic drum set, offering an immersive and enjoyable experience for users.

Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the Virtual Drum is a non-commercial creation, conceived for entertainment and musical exploration. Its simple and intuitive interface allows users of all ages to experiment and appreciate the feeling of playing a drum without the need for physical equipment.

Have fun exploring the different sounds and rhythms available on the Virtual Drum, and let your musical creativity flow freely.
